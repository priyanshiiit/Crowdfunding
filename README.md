# CROWDFUNDING PLATFORM âœ¨

## Brief Description 
A crowdfunding platform where user can browse through different campaigns and support the cause by donating some amount of money.
The payment is done via the PayTM gateway & complete transparency and anonymity of the process is ensured.

## Features and Functionalities ðŸ˜ƒ

**User features**
 - User can see the ongoing campaigns on the landing page.
 - User can click on the campaign they want to support and then be directed to the specific campaign page where they can see the campaign details.
 - User can then support the campaign by donating the amount they would like to via PayTM.
 - User can also share the campaign among their friends/colleagues/relatives to increase the reach of the campagin via the share-feature.
 - User can see the amount details of the transaction after the payment is done on that campaign page in the List of Donation. (Anonymity is ensured)
 - User can send us their queries via the form provided in the 'Contact-Us' section.
 
 **Admin features** 
 
 - All above features are included for the admin as well.
 - Admin can start a new campaign by filling in the project details such as campaign title, required amount etc.
 - Admin can deactivate an ongoing campaign when the need is fulfilled or before (due to any possible reason).
 - Admin can edit the details of an ongoing campaign (not allowed to change the raised amount).
 - Only an admin can add another new admin (if required, for any purpose). 
 
 **CRUD** functions can be called by users to perform different types of operations on selected data within the database. 

 **Note** : We have created a default admin. The route for the LOGIN section is not kept in the UI. One can access it through website_url/admin/login where they are required to   enter the login credentials. The motive behind doing this was that we thought it would seem a bit weird for the general users to be able to see the LOGIN section when there is no need of it to make a payment which is the prominient feature in our website.
 
 ## Tech Stack ðŸ’»
 
 **MERN** stack has been used for the development of this website.

## Components include:
 - API calling (calling to PayTM gateway)

 ## Thought behind the project
 
My motive behind choosing this project was to build a platform that can come to practical use in real world. I saw the need of a crowd-funding webapp for our **ROTARACT CLUB** in IIITM that can provide smooth functionality as well as transparency of payments for the various campaigns/charities carried out via ROTARACT. So, I decided to come up with  this project that can provide a good user experience as well as ensure the transparency of the payments carried out. And, also serve as a platform working for a good cause.
